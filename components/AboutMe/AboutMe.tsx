            My name is <strong>Upal Barua</strong>, and I'm a designer and
            developer who is passionate about creating intuitive and dynamic
            websites and web apps. Over the past 3 years, I have been dedicated
            to learning and mastering my craft, and I am currently focused on
            designing and developing digital solutions using the MERN stack. I
            am particularly skilled in CSS and React.As a tech enthusiast, I am
            always seeking to expand my knowledge and improve myself, both
            personally and professionally.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.Text}>
            Aside from coding, I love listening to music and having deep
            conversations with others about life, philosophy, and everything in
            between. I believe that being able to connect with others on a
            deeper level is essential to building strong relationships and
            creating meaningful work.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.Text}>
            If you have a project in mind or just want to chat, feel free to get
            in touch. I would love to hear from you!
